# Glotto

**Glotto** is a modern, scalable backend API platform for a multilingual learning application. It powers a front-end language-learning app with APIs for user authentication, lessons, video streaming, progress tracking, and gamification features.

Built with **feature-based Clean Architecture**, Glotto ensures modular, testable, and maintainable code. It supports background processing, observability, and load-balanced deployments, making it production-ready for high-scale environments.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Feature-Based Clean Architecture**  
  Organizes code by features (e.g., Auth, Courses, Videos, Lessons, Subscriptions) for better maintainability and extensibility.

- **Background Jobs with Hangfire**  
  Handles video uploads, transcoding, notifications, and reminders reliably, decoupled from API request threads.

- **Observability with OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana**  
  Collects traces, metrics, and logs for API requests, background jobs, and system performance, enabling monitoring of latency, failures, and throughput.

- **Mapster for Object Mapping**  
  Provides fast, clean DTO ‚Üî entity mapping for commands, queries, and responses.

- **Scalar API Documentation**  
  Auto-generated, interactive API documentation for seamless integration with front-end developers.

- **Database Support**  
  Supports PostgreSQL or SQL Server for scalable relational data storage, optimized for multilingual content.

- **Load-Balanced Ready**  
  Designed to run behind Nginx or HAProxy for high-traffic scenarios, ensuring API availability and reliability.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Glotto locally:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlrzAmini/glotto.git
   cd glotto
   ```

2. **Configure the database connection**  
   Update the connection string in `src/Glotto.Api/appsettings.json`:  
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=GlottoDb;Username=your_username;Password=your_password"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Apply EF Core migrations to initialize the database**  
   Ensure you have the EF Core CLI tools installed (`dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`), then run:  
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project src/Glotto.Infrastructure
   ```

4. **Start the backend API**  
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Glotto.Api
   ```

5. **Access the API**  
   - The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in `appsettings.json`).  
   - View the Scalar API documentation at `https://localhost:5001/api-docs`.

## üß™ Running Tests

Glotto includes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality. Run tests using:

```bash
dotnet test
```

---

## üìä Observability Setup

To set up observability with Prometheus and Grafana:

1. **Configure OpenTelemetry** in `appsettings.json` for trace and metric exports.  
2. Run Prometheus and Grafana using Docker Compose:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d
   ```
3. Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` and configure dashboards for Glotto metrics.
