# Glotto

**Glotto** is a modern, scalable backend API platform for a multilingual learning application. It provides all the APIs needed to power a front-end language-learning app, including user authentication, lessons, video streaming, progress tracking, and gamification features.

It is designed with **feature-based Clean Architecture** to keep the code modular, testable, and maintainable. Glotto supports background processing, observability, and load-balanced deployments, making it ready for production at scale.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Feature-Based Clean Architecture**  
  Organizes code by features (Auth, Courses, Videos, Lessons, Subscriptions) instead of types, making it easier to maintain and extend.

- **Background Jobs with Hangfire**  
  Reliable processing for video uploads, transcoding, notifications, and reminders, separate from API request threads.

- **Observability with OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana**  
  Collects traces, metrics, and logs for API requests, background jobs, and system performance. Enables monitoring of latency, failures, and throughput.

- **Mapster for Object Mapping**  
  Fast and clean DTO ‚Üî entity mapping for commands, queries, and responses.

- **Scalar API Documentation**  
  Auto-generated, browsable API docs to make the backend easily consumable for front-end developers.

- **Database Support**  
  PostgreSQL or SQL Server for relational data storage, optimized for scalability and multi-language content.

- **Load Balanced Ready**  
  Designed to run behind Nginx or HAProxy for high-traffic scenarios, ensuring API availability and reliability.
